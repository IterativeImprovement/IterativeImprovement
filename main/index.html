                   <p>Yo,</p>
                   
                   <p>First off: I officially finished coding this profile on Oct 17 2019. I essentially spent the whole of the 16th analysing demo code from a website and moving it here haha. #feelproudmoment.</p>
                <p>Sure you are all here to know about me tho. <img class="emoji" src=https://img.hexrpg.com/images/icon_look.gif></p>
                
                <p> I am Lily, member of HEX for 4 years as of June 2021 (poke future me if I forget to update this). Formerly known as Little White Dragon.</p>
                
                <p>I love games. Unfortunately don't have a console so I've been toggling between laptop/PC and phone my whole life. Really should do Animal Crossing someday lol. || June 2021 update: I have a Switch now! Been playing a lot of BoTW, just completed Zora's Domain</p>
                
                <p>I can't chat without emojis. <img class="emoji" src=https://img.hexrpg.com/images/icon_lol.gif> There's just something very weird when you post without anything moving in it...and I'm too poor at gifs to go looking for those. xD</p>
                
                <p>I am determined to accomplish my goals (eg. coding my profile without asking anyone) yet I procrastinate a lot. I love reading, writing, coding, logic and Math.  (obviously).</p>
                
                <p>Hmm...anything else? I'm your typical angsty teen. xD "It's a phase", they said. <img class="emoji" src=https://img.hexrpg.com/images/icon_look.gif>
                </p>
                
                <p>Lies.</p>
                
                <p>I also had a habit of cannabalism in my time of being Little White Dragon. That was a phase. I don't eat people any more. <img class="emoji" src=https://img.hexrpg.com/images/icon_lol.gif> <img class="emoji" src=https://img.hexrpg.com/images/icon_shifty.gif>
                </p>
                
                <p>I love fish, ehhhh on sashimi though. Being Chinese, I'm a huge sucker for Chinese food - Sichuan spicy is my favourite kind of spicy. Japanese curry is next.
                </p>
                
                <p>Finally - Did I mention that I love Undertale? <img class="emoji" src=https://img.hexrpg.com/images/icon_look.gif> 
                My personal favourites are Undyne for heroism and Alphys for relatability. But...this graphic was too hard to pass up.</p>
                
                <p>And for people who managed to read thus far, here's a checker.  <img class="emoji" src=https://img.hexrpg.com/images/icon_shifty.gif></p>

                   <p>(writing this in Nov 2020)</p>
    
    <p>Sooo I'm lazy to update the previous page but a small update on me.</p>
    
    <p>I am obssessed with drawing (iPad + Apple Pencil). Probably won't do it as a career but I want to make some cool stuff that I can post to my twitter.</p>
    
    <p>Also Genshin is sooo nice to look at aesthetically and to get references for. AR 44 at time of writing this; I'm freaking obsessed. Waifus would be Beidou & Ningguang, husbando would be Zhongli. I love Diluc's mood; Kaeya is hot; and Fischl's design is mmm.  </p>
